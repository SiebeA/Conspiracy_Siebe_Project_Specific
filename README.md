# Conspiracy_Siebe_Project_Specific

This is the repository that is specific to Siebe's project

Info on the files within the repository:
  - the files that are numbers are subject to be executed within an order; their number is their place within that order
    - As a whole, this comprises the TextClassification_pipeline by which the baseline is set
  - the files under the 'readme file' (with 'featureEnrichment' in the title) are for feature_engineering; eventually, these models will also be input in the TextPipeline from step 3 (GridsearchCV) onwards: then the results can be compared and the Research Question--Can the use of external data improve the performance of a text classification model for detecting conspiratorial video transcripts on a small unbalanced dataset?--can be answered, as the models includes externally derived features, by which the original features are enriched.
